# Enviroment Config

This is a project created to save configuration of my developed enviroment. I've included tools like:

- Nvim: Text editor
- Karabiner: Control screens
- StarShip: Edit terminal interface
- Tmux: Navigate terminal interfaces

I also included some system config files, where enviromental variables are declared to make this all configuration work.

## How is it work?

To include this config in your system first is necessary to install the tools, and after move all config files to the folder ~/.config.
